# personal-website
This is a personal website that I made of one of the customer whom I worked for.
To run this website:
-> Install xampp
-> Extract the website and keep the extracted folder in C:/xampp/htdocs/
-> Now open xampp application and run apache and mysql server
-> After that open your web browser and write localhost/(extracted folder name)
-> The website is all yours.
